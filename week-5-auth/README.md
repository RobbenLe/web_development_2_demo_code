## About

This project contains vue code related to authentication.

This project needs the API to be running at the same time (read the README) [https://github.com/danpaul/web_development_2_api_boilerplate](https://github.com/danpaul/web_development_2_api_boilerplate)

After the API is up and running, run the following to get started:

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

Important files related to auth:

- `src/components/Auth.vue` - handles login and registration
- `src/components/ArticleUpdateImproved.vue` - reference for loading and error states/components
