## About

This project contains a article app demonstrating how to make API requests inside a Vue app.

This project needs the API to be running at the same time (read the README) [https://github.com/danpaul/web_development_2_api_boilerplate](https://github.com/danpaul/web_development_2_api_boilerplate)

After the API is up and running, run the following to get started:

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

The main files are:

- `src/main.js` - create the router
- `src/App.vue` - main template
